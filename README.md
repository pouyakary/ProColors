__Pro Colors__ is a theme designed in the most careful manners for harmony and happy looking. The idea is to have a theme that looks pretty and reminds you of candy, has harmony in it's look, changes the feel of programming to something completely different and is fairly professional. You can read more about the philosophy behind the design of __Pro Colors__ [in this blog post](http://kary.us/2017/05/16/my-journey-to-clean-code/) by Pouya Kary.

## First-class Language Support
__Pro Colors__ supports a big range of languages very good. It fully implements the [TextMate's tmTheme colors](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/color_schemes_tmtheme.html) so all of the languages are supported, but Pro Colors provides first-class support for these languages, First-class support means that Pro Colors has custom coloring for all the tokens and grammars of these languages, all the colors of these languages are designed in such that for the most combinations of code they look harmonized.
